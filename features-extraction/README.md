# Features extraction

In this directory, we provide a few scripts for extracting features using different image/video backbones. 
These features can be used to train a new HiERO variant.

Our pipeline is designed to extract dense features (e.g., from a sequence of adjacent video frames) using Nvidia DALI for fast processing.
