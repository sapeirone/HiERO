                Human activities are particularly complex and variable, and this
                makes challenging for deep learning models to reason about them.
                However, we note that such variability does have an underlying
                structure, composed of a hierarchy of patterns of related
                actions. We argue that such structure can emerge naturally from
                unscripted videos of human activities, and can be leveraged to
                better reason about their content. We present HiERO, a
                weakly-supervised method to enrich video segments features with
                the corresponding hierarchical activity threads. By aligning
                video clips with their narrated descriptions, HiERO infers
                contextual, semantic and temporal reasoning with an hierarchical
                architecture. We prove the potential of our enriched features
                with multiple video-text alignment benchmarks (EgoMCQ, EgoNLQ)
                with minimal additional training, and in zero-shot for procedure
                learning tasks (EgoProceL and Ego4D Goal-Step). Notably, HiERO
                achieves state-of-the-art performance in all the benchmarks, and
                for procedure learning tasks it outperforms fully-supervised
                methods by a large margin (+12.5% F1 on EgoProceL) in zero shot.
                Our results prove the relevance of using knowledge of the
                hierarchy of human activities for multiple reasoning tasks in
                egocentric vision.

            💡 How are human actions modeled by video models?
          </h3>
          <p>
            Human activities are complex, hierarchical and goal-oriented. We
            question how different video understanding models encode such
            hierarchy in the features space. We take a video and extract
            features from dense segments. Then we compute the pairwise feature
            similarity for the entire video.

                  Colored rectangles indicate the ground truth steps. Ideally,
                  we expect high similarity if two segments represent
                  semantically similar steps. With Omnivore features, this
                  behavior is only partially visible. On EgoVLP features, we
                  observe sharper clusters of temporal segments that are not
                  necessarily close temporally, but represent similar high-level
                  actions. Our approach makes this behavior even more visible.

            We design HiERO based on the intuition that, given a sufficiently

          <i>functional dependencies</i> between actions naturally emerge

            🔥 HiERO is good at video-language alignment...
          </h3>
          <p>
            We evaluate HiERO on EgoMCQ and EgoNLQ to validate its video-text
            alignment capabilities and to show that reasoning on functional
            threads at different scales can support various video understanding
            tasks. Together, video-narrations alignment and functional
            clustering are effective to discriminate between similar short-term
            actions, which is critical for EgoMCQ, as well as to capture
            long-range causal and temporal dependencies in the video, which is
            essential for EgoNLQ.

          </h4>
          <p>
            We evaluate HiERO on EgoProceL in <i>zero-shot</i>, using visual
            features extracted from the Omnivore and EgoVLP backbones. we
            evaluate on this benchmark the ability of HiERO to group together
            parts of the video that correspond to the same high-level activity
            by leveraging their functional similarity, even though it was not
            trained explicitly to identify procedure steps inside a video.

          <p>
            We also evaluate HiERO on the Step-Grounding and Step Localization
            tasks from Ego4D Goal-Step, both in zero-shot and supervised
            settings. Compared to supervised approaches that learn a direct
            mapping between the video and the procedure steps, we argue that the
            steps detected by HiERO emerge as composition of low-level patterns
            that are clustered together.
